## What I Learned
Hello guys, today I was casually scrolling through Youtube to watch some videos, and then suddenly I came to this video of NetworkChuck, the video was about how to get start with blog. And I was interested as I, from recently, wanted create a blog, like how to get start with blogging, how to write the blogs and all. So, I decided to watch that video  and this whole blog is the result of that video. I want to share what were the steps for starting with blogging. 
## Setup
Firstly let's talk about the tools which we used. 
- **Hugo** : It is a static site generator written in Go, optimized for speed and designed for flexibility.
- **Obsidian**: It is the platform or editor where I wrote this text and all.
- **Go** : For running the static website.
- **Git**: This is used for saving or for version control of the blog.
