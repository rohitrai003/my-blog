&lt;p&gt;Hello guys, today I was casually scrolling through Youtube to watch some videos, and then suddenly I came to this video of NetworkChuck, the video was about how to get start with blog. And I was interested as I, from recently, wanted create a blog, like how to get start with blogging, how to write the blogs and all. So, I decided to watch that video  and this whole blog is the result of that video. I want to share what were the steps for starting with blogging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the tools which we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hugo&lt;/strong&gt; : It is a static site generator written in Go, optimized for speed and designed for flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obsidian&lt;/strong&gt;: It is the platform or editor where I wrote this text and all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go&lt;/strong&gt; : For running the static website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git&lt;/strong&gt;: This is used for saving or for version control of the blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
